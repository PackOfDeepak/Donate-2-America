                <p>Every day, our teams deliver emergency medical aid to those who need it most. As we carry out this work, we are guided by the rules of medical ethics—particularly the duty to provide care without causing harm to individuals or groups.

                    We’re also committed to safeguarding our patients’ rights to autonomy, confidentiality, and informed consent. We respect the dignity of our patients, which includes respect for their cultural and religious beliefs.
                    
                    In accordance with these principles, we endeavor to provide the best medical care possible to all patients.
