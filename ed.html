        <div id = "sa"><a href="https://donations.scholarshipamerica.org/index.php?" target="_blank"><h3>1.Scholarship America</a></h3>
            <p>At Scholarship America, we’re passionate about student success. It’s what drives us. And it’s what gets us up in the morning — developing leading scholarship solutions and partnering with people who also believe that a student should never, ever give up on their dream because they didn’t think it was possible.

                    <p>Room to Read seeks to transform the lives of millions of children in low-income communities by focusing on literacy and gender equality in education. Working in collaboration with local communities, partner organizations and governments, we develop literacy skills and a habit of reading among primary school children, and support girls to complete secondary school with the relevant life skills to succeed in school and beyond.
