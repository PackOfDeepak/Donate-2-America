        <div id = "nkh"><a href="https://www.nokidhungry.org/" target="_blank"><h3>1.No Kid Hungry</a></h3>
        <p>No Kid Hungry is a national campaign run by Share Our Strength,
             a nonprofit working to solve problems of hunger and poverty in the United States and around the world.
              After 25 years of successfully investing in local nonprofits and helping find the best approaches to eradicating poverty and hunger, Share Our Strength launched No Kid Hungry in 2010.

            As a child hunger organization, ending childhood hunger is our primary focus, though Share Our Strength continues to invest in and develop other campaigns.</p></div>
  <div id = "sj"><a href="https://www.stjude.org/donate/donate-to-st-jude.html?sc_icid=header-btn-donate-now" target="_blank"><h3>2.St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital</a></h3>
                <p>The mission of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is to advance cures, and means of prevention, for pediatric catastrophic diseases through research and treatment. Consistent with the vision of our founder Danny Thomas, no child is denied treatment based on race, religion or a family's ability to pay.

                   <div id = "cnh"><a href="https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/donate/" target="_blank"><h3>3.Children's Miracle Network Hospitals</a></h3>
                        <p>More than 10 million kids enter a children’s hospital like The Children's Hospital at Saint Francis across North America every year. To provide the best care for kids, children’s hospitals rely on donations and community support, as Medicaid and insurance programs do not fully cover the cost of care. Since 1983, Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals has helped fill those funding gaps by raising more than $7 billion, most of it $1 at a time through Miracle Balloon icon campaigns. Its various fundraising partners and programs support the nonprofit’s mission to save and improve the lives of as many children as possible.
